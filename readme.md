# Node.js Test Runner

[Node.js test runner](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/test.html#test-runner) demo. This repo shows how to set additional code transformations and to avoid compatibility issues between CommonJS and ECMAScript modules.

Flow static types are used as an example. And the types are removed by [flow-remove-types](https://flow.org/en/docs/tools/flow-remove-types/) module.
